The SEO scan project is made with several programming languages like React JS, Node JS, HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to scrape data from APIs to show insights in the performance, SEO score and accessibility. The SEO project is used for learning purposes to check related keywords in google SERP findings. SERP means Search Engine Result Page and in the tool, we scrape that data from a Google API. In addition, we also use the API of Google lighthouse to parse the data and show website users their overall performance. From there on they can choose to optimize it or leave it. Features like previous search history and account creation date people can see their previous searches.

The reason why I created this application because lately I have been specializing more in SEO. Being involved in the same subject now has also allowed me to really focus on the backend processes of this type of project. After all, I had never worked with React and Node JS before. It was therefore also a lot of figuring out for me to make the connection and deploy the project instead of use it locally. Therefore, my motivation is also to expand this project because in addition to theoretical knowledge, I learn much faster when I do it.

How to run it locally:

{Frontend starten}

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. <br />


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. <br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. <br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back! **

In the next version the profile page will have some add-ons like storing the searched reports and giving advice to improve the scores. It will also be possible to customize an avatar. I did not manage to get this kind of styling thing done within the deadline because I spent a lot of time with the connection between the backend and the front end
